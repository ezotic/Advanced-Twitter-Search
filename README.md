# Advanced-Twitter-Search

Proposal

My proposal is an Advanced Twitter search. The basic search found on your twitter page is basic and result a search that is too broad.
There is a twitter advanced search feature that can be found at https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en
I want to reproduce this search by using the twitter api found at https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api


Design

1. Requirements:    Search for "All typed words", "exact phrase", "any words", "none of these words", "from account(s)", Dates from "Month-day-year to Month-day-year"
2. Mockup:  Photos are in ./img directory


3. Model:
4. Service Contract:
5. External Services: Twitter api will be used https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api
